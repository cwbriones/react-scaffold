React scaffold
======

A quick-and-dirty setup for my own tinkering with ReactJS.
I use makefiles. Deal with it.

Includes:
  * `build` - Browserify for bundling, direct copy of other static assets.
  * `lint`  - Flow/ESLint for linting and static analysis (if you're into that sort of thing).
  * `test`  - Testing with a cup of Mocha Chai.
  * `prod`  - Uglification and minification with UglifyJS2 on production builds.
  * `watch` - Watchify + Node Livereload and Livereactload for quicker debugging sessions.
